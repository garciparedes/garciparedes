## About Me
Hi everyone! I’m a double Bachelor’s degree graduate in **Computer Engineering** and (future graduate) in **Statistics** from the University of Valladolid, in Spain. I love to solve complex algorithmic problems, especially those based on **Combinatorial Optimization** via tricky techniques. Also, I enjoy applying Mathematical and Statistical approaches to develop amazing solutions. Lately, I’m curious about **Sequential Models**, **Architectural Patterns** and the **Rust Programming Language**. Currently, I’m happily working at **Unlimiteck Company** Builder developing tools to solve complex combinatorial problems.
