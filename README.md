### Software Engineering | Statistics | RPA | Combinatorial Optimization

## Description
Hi everyone! Iâ€™m a double Bachelorâ€™s degree graduate in Computer Engineering and (future graduate) in Statistics from the University of Valladolid, in Spain. I love to solve complex algorithmic problems, especially those based on Combinatorial Optimization via tricky techniques. Also, I enjoy applying Mathematical and Statistical approaches to develop amazing solutions. Lately, Iâ€™m curious about Sequential Models, Architectural Patterns and the Rust Programming Language. Currently, Iâ€™m happily working at Unlimiteck Company Builder developing tools to solve complex combinatorial problems.
